# Guardian-Image-Replacer

This is a browser extension for Chrome-based browsers. It is a fork of MysteryPancake's Image-Replacer extension. 
I have added the ability to remove images that are set as a background image in div HTML elements on a webpage.

Installation: 
1. Unzip file.
2. To install go to the part of your browser that deals with managing your extensions.
3. Select load unpacked.
4. Navigate to the location of the folder named "Guardian-Image-Replacer" (not the folder that ends with main) and select it.

Instructions: 
1. To remove just images that are coded as HTML elements with an "img" tag, check the standard images button and hit the save button.
2. To remove all images on a page, check both boxes and hit save.
3. In order for the extension to work properly at this current time, a URL for an image must be added to the text box and saved.
