# Guardian-Image-Replacer

This is a browser extension for Chrome-based browsers. It is a fork of MysteryPancake's Image-Replacer extension. 
I have added the ability to remove images that are set as a background image in divs on a webpage.

Instructions: 
1. To remove just images that are set coded as HTML elements with an "img" tag, check the standard images button and hit the save button.
2. To remove all images on a page, check both boxes and hit save
3. In order for the extension to work properly at this current time a URL for an image must be added to the text box and saved.
